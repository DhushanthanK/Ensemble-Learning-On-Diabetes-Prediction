# Ensemble Learning: Bagging Tutorial

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of ensemble learning techniques, specifically Bagging and Random Forest, to predict if a person has diabetes based on certain features such as blood pressure, skin thickness, age, etc. We will use the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset for this purpose.

## Project Structure

- `diabetes_prediction.py`: Contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `diabetes.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
