# Ensemble Learning on diabetes prediction

## Overview

In this tutorial, we will use the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset to predict whether a person has diabetes based on features such as blood pressure, skin thickness, age, etc. We will start by training a standalone model and then use ensemble learning techniques, including Bagging and Random Forest, to improve the model's performance.

## Project Structure

- `diabetes_prediction.py`: Contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `diabetes.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
